Pymaceuticals Conclusions

1. Mice treated with Capomulin showed a reduction in the tumor volume over 45 days, proof of this is mice s185 that started with a 45 mm3 tumor and ended up with a 23.34 mm3 tumor.
2. Only Capomulin and Ramicane achieved a tumor reduction. The rest of the drugs seem to fail at getting this effect;  contrary, the tumor kept growing over time.
3. By applying the linear regression model we can observe a positive correlation between the mice weight and the tumor volume, the heavier the mouse the bigger the tumor.
